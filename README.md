# üìò Job Portal Application

This is a full-stack Job Portal web app that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to register, log in, manage their profile, and apply for jobs. Employers can post job openings and view applicants.

I built this project to practice real-world web development using modern technologies and to improve my backend and frontend skills.
